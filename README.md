I am a student specializing in Data Science, Bioinformatics, and related fields. In the upcoming course, I will be taking a Web Engineering subject, so I decided to start practicing by creating a web portfolio.

At first, I manually edited the _config.yml file to create a simple interface, but now I prefer using a template from [html5up](https://html5up.net/solid-state). I am refactoring it to create a better portfolio for a data scientist.
